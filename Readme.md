# Usage instructions

1. Download the evaluations from Gradescope under the "Review Grades" view of the assignment.
1.  Extract the problem evaluations to a folder where you want to create the prescription file.  Rename it to something meaningful, e.g. quiz9-evaluations.csv.
1. Within this folder run the recitation_sheet.py script using the following arguments:

`./recitation_sheet.py OPTIONS`

> where OPTIONS include:
>   --evaluations [evaluation csv file]
>   --title [title of assignment]
>   -c [n] p1 p2 p3

Note that this should be all on the same line.
